    <h3>ID</h3>
    <div id="mainbox" class="division">
        <p> &ltdiv id="mainbox"&gt this gives a unique id to element</p>
        <p> &ltdiv class="divisoin"&gt this gives aclass name to element</p>
    </div>
    <p>id helps in css to uniquely change properties. Eg changing font size of a unique element.</p>
    <p>class is used to give properties to all elements having same class. eg: there are many elements like p tag, div tag and if you want to change font of all as same then include them in one class and css with edit all at once.</p>
